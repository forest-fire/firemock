The **firemock** database sits alongside a number of other Firebase related modules that we've developed. I've put these under the GitHub organization "ForestFire" and you can find them all here:

All of these modules leverage this library for database mocking functionality; only `abstracted-admin` doesn't use the **Auth** mocking (because the Admin SDK doesn't expose Auth).
